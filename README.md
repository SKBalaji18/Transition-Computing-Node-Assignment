# Simple Checklist System using Node.js, React, and Express

## Project Overview

This project is a **Checklist System** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **React.js**. The system evaluates a set of conditions based on input data fetched from a provided API. It processes this data, checks various rules, and displays the results in a simple dashboard format showing whether each rule has passed or failed.

## Features & Requirements
**Clean Code:**  The code should follow best practices and be modular, making it easy to read and extend.

**Modularity:**
The checklist rules and evaluation logic should be separated in such a way that adding or modifying rules is straightforward without major changes to the codebase.

**Dashboard Display:** A dashboard should display the status (Passed/Failed) of each rule.

**Future Proofing:** The system should be designed so that adding new conditions to the checklist doesn't require large-scale changes.

## Combined Project (for development): 
Run the following in the project root directory to start both the backend and frontend servers:  **npm run dev**
